## [collabor8r.com](http://collabor8r.com) source code

### William H. Knapp III

This github repository contains nearly all the source code and files that
I used to create collabor8r.com. Notable absences are:

1. private.php
  * Contains information about connecting to the database I used.
  * Contains my private email address used for emailing myself about
    errors or emailing users.
  * Contains a function to test whether the user is an administrator.
2. the sandy directory
  * Contains test code that I'm working on to add additional functionality
    or information to the site. When this code is solid, it is used to
    update r8rfuncs.php.
3. .htpasswd
  * Nope, you're not getting the password to access private stuff online.
